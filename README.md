* **Habit Tracker with Gamification & Insights**

* ****Over All Project Overview**
This project is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to track daily habits and transform them into actionable insights using a gamified approach.

*** Problem Statement**
Tracking habits manually does not provide visibility into consistency, missed habits, or performance trends. This project solves that by converting daily habit data into meaningful KPIs and interactive dashboards.

* **Solution**
  
- Designed a habit tracking system using Google Sheets
- Normalized daily habit data into a fact table
- Built a star schema data model
- Created DAX measures for completion %, missed habits, and habit score
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with gamification elements

* **Key Metrics**
  
- Total Habits Logged
- Completed Habits
- Missed Habits
- Completion %
- Habit Score

* **Tools Used**
- Google Sheets
- Data cleaning
- Data Normalization
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
- ***Tech Stack:**
• Google Sheets (Data collection & validation)
• Power BI (Data modeling, DAX, visualization)
• DAX (KPIs, habit score, completion metrics)
• GitHub (Version control & documentation)

* **Outcome Of This Project**
The dashboard helps analyze habit consistency, identify weak areas, and improve productivity through data-driven insights.

**Pipeline Of This Project Gamified-Habit-Tracking-Productive-Analytics-System**
Built an end-to-end habit tracking and productivity analytics system using Google Sheets and Power BI. Designed a normalized data model, created DAX measures for completion rate, missed habits, and habit score, and delivered an interactive dashboard with KPIs, category insights, and trend analysis.

* **How To Use**

1. Enter daily habit completion in Google Sheets
2. Refresh Power BI dataset
3. Dashboard updates automatically with KPIs and insights
