* **Habit Tracker with Gamification & Insights**

* ****Over All Project Overview**
This project is an end-to-end analytics solution designed to track daily habits and transform them into actionable insights using a gamified approach.

*** Problem Statement**
Tracking habits manually does not provide visibility into consistency, missed habits, or performance trends. This project solves that by converting daily habit data into meaningful KPIs and interactive dashboards.

* **Solution**
  
- Designed a habit tracking system using Google Sheets
- Normalized daily habit data into a fact table
- Built a star schema data model
- Created DAX measures for completion %, missed habits, and habit score
- Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with gamification elements

* **Key Metrics**
  
- Total Habits Logged
- Completed Habits
- Missed Habits
- Completion %
- Habit Score

* **Tools Used**
- Google Sheets
- Data cleaning
- Data Normalization
- Power BI
- DAX
- Data Modeling
